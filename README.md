# CS250 - Software Development Life Cycle
This repository is a portfolio of projects created for my CS250 course at Southern New Hampshire University.

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?
One way to do this is through user research and analysis, which involves gathering information about the target users of the software and their needs and goals. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as interviews, surveys, focus groups, and user testing.

Once the user needs have been identified, the next step is to implement them in the software design. This can be done by incorporating the user needs into the requirements and specifications for the software, and then using them to guide the development process. For example, if one of the identified user needs is the ability to perform a specific task quickly and easily, the software design might include features such as intuitive navigation and clear instructions to help users accomplish that task efficiently.

# How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories can be useful in helping to determine user needs because they provide a clear and concise description of the user's perspective and goals. By reading and analyzing a set of user stories, developers can gain a better understanding of the users and what they need from the software. This can then be used to guide the design and development process, ensuring that the software is tailored to the needs and goals of its target users.

# How do I approach developing programs?
My approach to developing programs is to make everything as simple and efficient as possible. First, I begin by identifying the audience, conducting a needs assessment, and assessing my production environment. Next, I move to the design and plan phase, in which goals and objectives are established. Implementation includes testing and refining requirements. Finally, the program is evaluated to determine the results and impact.

# What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
The agile processes I hope to incorporate into my future development work are daily meetings, estimation techniques, and the kanban board to help visualize work.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I think that being a good team member in software development means being reliable, communicative, and willing to collaborate with others. It also means being able to take on different roles and responsibilities within a team, as well as being willing to learn new ideas and adapt to the ever-changing circumstances. Additionally, being self-organizing and having a positive attitude can go a long way in helping a team work well together. Ultimately, being a good team member in software development means working towards a common goal of creating high-quality software by maximizing efficiency and effectiveness.
